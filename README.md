ToDoList for HitPay

There are two fragments, first for loading the list and second for adding a ToDo item to the list.
You may delete the item in the list by holding the item until the 'Delete' text appears.

There are two buttons below to prepopulate the list with 2,000 items and delete the data in the database respectively.

You may need to download .idea files on your own to build the project.
